Project: PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience

Description:

Big thanks to PwC and Forage, it was a wonderful experience working on the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience. I can get a taste of what interns at PwC may work on in relation to data visualization and analysis. It was amazing at working on cases and having experience with real-life problems. I helped with quick business decisions by sharing insights from the data, excited to participate more in the future.

I had to finish 3 tasks in this program:

1. Visualizing customer and agent behavior of call center.
2. Customer demographics and insights.
3. Gender balance in the executive suite.

| 2	| 02 Churn-Dataset		| Customer Retention Dashboard_v2	|
